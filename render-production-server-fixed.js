At 20, he moved to Honolulu, Hawaii to manage two underperforming stores, demonstrating his ability to turn around challenging operations.

Over the years, he has built and managed a substantial real estate portfolio, gaining invaluable experience in property acquisition, renovation, management, and strategic exits. His hands-on approach and deep understanding of market dynamics have enabled him to identify undervalued properties and transform them into profitable investments.\n\nIn 2024, Michael made the strategic decision to sell his existing portfolio to focus exclusively on multifamily syndication through MB Capital Group. This pivot allows him to leverage his decades of experience while partnering with passive investors to acquire larger, more impactful properties. Michael\'s commitment to transparency, conservative underwriting, and investor education sets MB Capital Group apart in the syndication space.\n\nToday, Michael leads MB Capital Group with a focus on Class B and C multifamily properties in emerging markets, where he sees the greatest potential for value creation and investor returns.
